## Lab 1:  Deploy and Build Applications

Duration: 40 minutes

In this lab, you will learn how to build and deploy both frontend and backend Spring applications to Azure Spring Apps. In order to develop a high-level grasp of how to deploy and operate the same, you will first attempt to set up a very basic hello-world Spring Boot app. After that, you will configure Spring Cloud Gateway, deploy the frontend and backend apps of ACME-FITNESS (the demo application you will use in this lab), and verify that you can access the frontend as well as the backend. Additionally, you will change the Spring Cloud Gateway rules for these backend apps and set them up to communicate with the Application Configuration Service and the Service Registry.

### Task 1: Deploy a Hello World service to ASA-E 

In this task, you will try to deploy a very simple hello-world Spring Boot app to get a high-level understanding of how to deploy an ASA-E app and access it.

### Task 2: Deploy a Frontend Application

 In this section, you are going to deploy the front end of ACME-FITNESS (the demo application that you will be using in this lab), configure it with Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG), and validate that you are able to access the front end. You will create a Spring Cloud Gateway instance for Acme-Fitness and connect all the frontend and backend services to this gateway instance. This way, the gateway instance acts as the proxy for any requests that are targeted towards the Acme-Fitness application. Routing rules bind endpoints in the request to the backend applications. In the task below, you will also create a rule in SCG for the frontend app.

The diagram below shows the final result once this section is complete:

   ![](Images/upd-frontend.png)
    
> **Please note that we have already deployed the Azure Spring app and created the required frontend app to save time during the lab.**
 
1. To assign a public endpoint and update the Spring Cloud Gateway configuration with API information, run the following command:

   ```shell
   az spring gateway update --assign-endpoint true
   export GATEWAY_URL=$(az spring gateway show | jq -r '.properties.url')
    
   az spring gateway update \
    --api-description "Acme Fitness Store API" \
    --api-title "Acme Fitness Store" \
    --api-version "v1.0" \
    --server-url "https://${GATEWAY_URL}" \
    --allowed-origins "*" \
    --no-wait
   ```

    ![](Images/mjv2-7-new.png)
    
   > **Note:** Please be aware that the below commands can run for up to two minutes. Hold off until the commands have been completed.

1. Run the following command to create a routing rule for the frontend application:
   
   ```shell
   az spring gateway route-config create \
    --name ${FRONTEND_APP} \
    --app-name ${FRONTEND_APP} \
    --routes-file ./routes/frontend.json
   ```
   ![](Images/frontend-route.png)

1. Run the following command to deploy and build the frontend application with its required parameters:
   
   ```shell
   az spring app deploy --name ${FRONTEND_APP} \
    --source-path ./apps/acme-shopping 
   ```
   ![](Images/frontend-deploy.png)
   
   > **Note:** Deploying the application will take approximately **2-3** minutes.

1. Run the following command. Copy the output URL and paste it in a browser.

   ```shell
   echo "https://${GATEWAY_URL}"
   ```
   ![](Images/mjv2-10.png)
  
   > **Note:** If you see the ACME-FITNESS home page displayed below, then it means that your frontend app and its corresponding route in SCG are configured correctly and deployed successfully. Explore the application, but notice that not everything is functioning yet. Continue on to the next exercise to configure the rest of the functionality.

### Task 3: Deploy Backend Applications

In this section, you are going to deploy the backend apps for the ACME-FITNESS application. You will also update the rules for these backend apps in Spring Cloud Gateway and configure these apps to talk to the Application Configuration Service and Service Registry. The Application Configuration Service is a feature of Azure Spring Apps Enterprise that makes Spring Apps configuration server capabilities available in a polyglot way. ASA-E internally uses the Tanzu Service Registry for dynamic service discovery.

The diagram below shows the final result once this section is complete:

   ![](Images/upd-scg-frontend-backend.png)

> **Please note that we have already deployed the Azure Spring app and created the required backend apps to save time during the lab.**

1. Run the following command to bind the spring applications to the Application Configuration Service:

   ```shell
   az spring application-configuration-service bind --app ${PAYMENT_SERVICE_APP}
   az spring application-configuration-service bind --app ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP}
   ```
    
   ![](Images/mjv2-5.png)
   
   > **Note:** Please note that the above commands can run for up to two minutes. 

1. Run the following command to bind the spring applications to the Service Registry:

   ```shell
   az spring service-registry bind --app ${PAYMENT_SERVICE_APP}
   az spring service-registry bind --app ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP}
   ```

   ![](Images/mjv2-6.png)

   > **Note:** Please note that the above commands can take up to two minutes to complete.

1. Run the following command to create routing rules for all backend applications:

    ```shell
    az spring gateway route-config create \
      --name ${CART_SERVICE_APP} \
      --app-name ${CART_SERVICE_APP} \
      --routes-file ./routes/cart-service.json
    
    az spring gateway route-config create \
      --name ${ORDER_SERVICE_APP} \
      --app-name ${ORDER_SERVICE_APP} \
      --routes-file ./routes/order-service.json

   az spring gateway route-config create \
      --name ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP} \
      --app-name ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP} \
      --routes-file ./routes/catalog-service.json
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Routing rules bind endpoints in the request to the backend applications. For example, in the Cart route below, the routing rule indicates any requests to /cart/** endpoint get routed to the backend Cart App.

   ![](Images/upd-mjv2-8.png)
   
   > **Note:** Please note that the above commands can run for up to two minutes. 

1. Run the following command to deploy and build each backend application with its required parameters:

    ```shell
    # Deploy Payment Service
    az spring app deploy --name ${PAYMENT_SERVICE_APP} \
       --config-file-pattern payment/default \
       --source-path ./apps/acme-payment \
       --build-env BP_JVM_VERSION=17

    # Deploy Catalog Service
    az spring app deploy --name ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP} \
       --config-file-pattern catalog/default \
       --source-path ./apps/acme-catalog \
       --build-env BP_JVM_VERSION=17

    # Deploy Order Service
    az spring app deploy --name ${ORDER_SERVICE_APP} \
       --source-path ./apps/acme-order 

    # Deploy Cart Service 
    az spring app deploy --name ${CART_SERVICE_APP} \
       --env "CART_PORT=8080" \
       --source-path ./apps/acme-cart 
    ```

   > **Note:** Deploying all applications will take approximately **10-15** minutes.

   ![](Images/mjv2-9-new.png)

1. Run the following command to get the Gateway URL.

   ```shell
   echo "https://${GATEWAY_URL}"
   ```
   ![](Images/mjv2-10.png)

1. Copy the Gateway URL and paste it into a new browser, and then you should see the ACME FITNESS Store application. Now that all the required apps are deployed, you should be able to open the home page and access it through the entire app. Explore the application, but notice that not everything is functioning yet. Continue to Lab 2 to configure Single Sign-On to enable the rest of the functionality (features like logging in, adding items to the cart, or placing an order).

   ![](Images/mjv2-11.png)

1. To assign an endpoint to API Portal, move back to Git Bash and run the following command:

   ```shell 
   az spring api-portal update --assign-endpoint true
   export PORTAL_URL=$(az spring api-portal show | jq -r '.properties.url')
   ```

1. Run the following command to get the API Portal URL.

   ```shell
   echo "https://${PORTAL_URL}"
   ```
   
   ![](Images/mjv2-12-new.png)
   
1. Copy the URL and paste it into a new browser, and then you should see the API portal for the ACME Fitness Store application.
